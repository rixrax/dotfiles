Project roadmap

The general idea is to add a list of required features for different releases here.

If a requirement seems too wide or undefined, it should be split into smaller requirements.

0.1
[x] Begin roadmap
[x] Add license
[x] Add readme
[x] Install script
[x] Git config

0.2
[ ] Bash config
-[x] PS1 prompt
-[x] History
-[x] Aliases
-[x] Enviromental vars and path

0.3
[ ] General vim config
[ ] Vim plugin config
